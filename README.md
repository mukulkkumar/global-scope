# global-scope
The global scope is actually a module scope. It exist only in single file. There is no concept of a truly global scope in python means it cannot exist across all the modules in the entire application. The only exception to this are some of the built-n global objects such as print, dict, None, True, False e.t.c

So, the built-in and global variable can be used anywhere inside the module.
